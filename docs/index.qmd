# What is Positron?

- Next-gen IDE for data science
- Was available for beta testing and has recently moved to stable release
- Fork of the open-source project that builds VS Code

# Who is the audience?

- Primarily R users
- Most experience with RStudio
- Maybe tried VS Code, Jupyter, etc.

# Ideology

- Polyglot (multilingual) IDE
- Support for both R and Python
- Unlike single-language IDEs (RStudio, MATLAB)
- Real-world projects often require different programming languages

# Familiarity

- Similar to RStudio (in layout - console, editor, help, plots)
- Based on VS Code OSS
